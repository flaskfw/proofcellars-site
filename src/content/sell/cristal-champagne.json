        {
            "question": "Does the orange wrapper matter?",
            "answer": "Yes. Cristal is bottled in clear glass, making it vulnerable to lightstrike ('skunking'). The orange wrapper protects it. Bottles with the wrapper intact are more valuable."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is Cristal Rosé valuable?",
            "answer": "Yes, it is produced in much smaller quantities than the Blanc and commands a much higher price."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is Vinothèque?",
            "answer": "These are bottles aged longer on the lees and released later by the house. They are very collectible."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you buy large formats?",
            "answer": "Yes, Cristal Magnums and Jeroboams are highly prized."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is 2008 a good vintage?",
            "answer": "2008 is widely considered a legend and is one of the most expensive recent vintages."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you buy older vintages?",
            "answer": "Yes, we look for vintages from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s."
