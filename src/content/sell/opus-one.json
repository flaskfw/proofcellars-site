            "question": "Do you buy Overture?",
            "answer": "Yes, Overture is the multi-vintage second wine of Opus One and is very popular."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you buy single bottles of Opus One?",
            "answer": "Yes, Opus One is in high demand, so we buy single bottles, 3-packs, and 6-packs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is older Opus One valuable?",
            "answer": "While Opus One is made in larger quantities, well-stored vintages from the 80s and 90s are sought after by collectors for vertical tastings."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do I need the wooden box?",
            "answer": "Opus One 6-packs come in wood. Having the original box is a plus for value."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I check the vintage on Overture?",
            "answer": "Overture is non-vintage (MV), but newer releases list the bottling date or release code on the back label."
        },
        {
            "question": "What if the tissue paper is torn?",
            "answer": "That is common and acceptable. The condition of the bottle/label underneath is what matters."
