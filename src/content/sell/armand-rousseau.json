            "question": "Which is more valuable, Chambertin or Bèze?",
            "answer": "Traditionally, the Chambertin commands a slightly higher price, but both are pinnacle wines."

            "answer": "We generally focus on the 1er Cru and Grand Cru bottlings, but will buy village wine in older vintages or large collections."
