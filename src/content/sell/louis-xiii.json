            "question": "Do I need the box and stopper?",
            "answer": "Yes, Louis XIII is a presentation piece. A missing box or stopper dramatically reduces value, though we may still make an offer."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do serial numbers need to match?",
            "answer": "Yes, for full value, the number on the stopper, the bottom of the decanter, and the booklet should match."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you buy empty bottles?",
            "answer": "No, we do not buy empty Louis XIII decanters."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is the Black Pearl valuable?",
            "answer": "Yes, the Black Pearl and Rare Cask editions are some of the most expensive spirits in the world."
        },
        {
            "question": "What if the crystal is chipped?",
            "answer": "Chips, especially on the side fins, will lower the offer price as it affects the aesthetic value."

            "question": "Do you buy older 1970s bottlings?",
            "answer": "Yes, we look for older bottlings from the 70s and 80s."
