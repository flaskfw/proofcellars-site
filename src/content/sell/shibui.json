            "question": "Is Shibui real Japanese whisky?",

            "question": "Do you buy the white oak releases?",
            "answer": "Yes, we buy the full aged range."

            "question": "How much is the 30 Year worth?",
            "answer": "It retails high, so secondary value is solid but expect a discount from retail."

        {
            "question": "Do I need the heavy box?",
            "answer": "Yes. Shipping without the custom box risks breaking the heavy bottle."
