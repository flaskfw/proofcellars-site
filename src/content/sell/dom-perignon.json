            "question": "What is P2 and P3?",
            "answer": "These are 'Plénitude' releases aged longer on the lees. P2 is aged ~15 years, P3 ~25 years. They are significantly more valuable than the standard vintage."
        },

            "question": "Do you buy Luminous bottles?",
            "answer": "Yes, we buy Luminous bottles. Ideally the light should still work, but we buy them regardless."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is the 2008 vintage special?",
            "answer": "Yes, 2008 is considered one of the greatest Champagne vintages in history."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you buy the Rosé?",
            "answer": "Yes, Dom Pérignon Rosé is highly collectible and more expensive than the Blanc."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do I need the box?",
            "answer": "For standard vintages, the box is helpful but not mandatory. For P2, P3, and special editions, the box is very important for value."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you buy older vintages?",
            "answer": "Yes, we look for well-stored bottles from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s."
