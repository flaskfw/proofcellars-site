            "question": "Which E.H. Taylor bottles are most valuable?",
            "answer": "Limited releases like Warehouse C Tornado Surviving, Cured Oak, and Four Grain are among the most valuable. Older batches of Barrel Proof also command a premium."

            "answer": "While not strictly required, the tube is a standard part of E.H. Taylor packaging. Missing tubes will reduce the offer price."
