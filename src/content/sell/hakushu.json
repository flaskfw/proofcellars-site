            "question": "What is the difference between Pure Malt and Single Malt?",
            "answer": "Older bottlings were labeled 'Pure Malt'. These are often more valuable to collectors than the modern 'Single Malt' labels."

            "answer": "For the 18 and 25 Year, the box is critical for full value. For the 12 Year, it is less important."
