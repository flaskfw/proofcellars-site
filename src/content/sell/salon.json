            "question": "Why is Salon so expensive?",
            "answer": "It is produced only in great years and held back for an average of 10 years before release. Production is tiny."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you buy the 2008 Magnum?",
            "answer": "Yes, the 2008 was released uniquely only in magnums as part of a special case. It is extremely valuable."

        {
            "question": "Do you buy Delamotte?",
            "answer": "We buy Delamotte if it is part of a larger cellar, but our primary focus is Salon."

        {
            "question": "Is 1996 a good year?",
            "answer": "1996 is considered one of the greatest vintages for Salon due to high acidity and longevity."

        {
            "question": "How do I sell my case?",
            "answer": "If you have a full wooden case (OWC), do not open it. Take photos of the case stamps and seals."
