      "question": "Which Macallan expressions do you buy?",
      "answer": "We buy Macallan 18 Year and older, Fine and Rare bottles, Lalique decanters, Edition Series, and other limited or collectible releases. Standard 12 Year expressions typically do not meet our criteria."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you buy Macallan Lalique decanters?",
      "answer": "Yes. We buy all Macallan Lalique editions. Decanter and stopper condition is important, as is the presence of the original presentation box."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know the value of my Macallan?",
      "answer": "Submit photos and details through our form or by text. We will evaluate based on expression, condition, packaging, and current market demand, then provide a specific offer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the original box add value?",
      "answer": "Yes. Original boxes, tubes, and presentation cases add significant value for Macallan. For Lalique editions, the presentation box is particularly important."
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition issues affect Macallan values?",
      "answer": "Fill level, seal integrity, and label condition are key factors. Original packaging completeness also matters. Minor wear may reduce value but usually does not disqualify."
