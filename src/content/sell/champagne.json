    {
      "question": "Which champagne houses do you buy?",
      "answer": "We buy prestige cuvees and vintage champagne from Dom Perignon, Krug, Cristal, Salon, Bollinger, Taittinger, and other collectible houses. We also consider grower champagnes from sought-after producers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you buy non-vintage champagne?",
      "answer": "We focus on vintage champagne and prestige cuvees. Non-vintage champagne from common producers typically does not meet our criteria unless it is from a collectible grower."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is storage for champagne?",
      "answer": "Storage is very important for champagne. Bottles stored at proper cellar temperatures retain better quality and value. If you know your storage conditions, include that information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition issues affect champagne values?",
      "answer": "Cork pushing, seepage, excessive ullage, and heat damage significantly reduce or eliminate value. Cosmetic label wear is less critical but still affects offers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the original box matter?",
      "answer": "Yes. Original gift boxes and presentation packaging add value for prestige cuvees. Include photos of any original packaging."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you buy larger format champagne bottles?",
      "answer": "Yes. We buy magnums, jeroboams, and other larger formats. Large format champagne often commands premium prices due to better aging and rarity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if my champagne is still good?",
      "answer": "Look for normal fill levels, intact corks without pushing, and no visible seepage. Send photos and we will evaluate. Champagne from unknown storage may need assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I receive an offer?",
      "answer": "We typically respond within one business day for champagne submissions."
