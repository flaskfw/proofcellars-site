    {
      "question": "What bourbon brands do you buy?",
      "answer": "We buy allocated and collectible bourbon from distilleries including Buffalo Trace (Van Winkle, BTAC, Weller, Blanton's, Stagg), Four Roses, Michter's, Willett, and others. Contact us with your specific bottles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you buy common bourbon like Maker's Mark or Buffalo Trace?",
      "answer": "We focus on allocated, limited edition, and collectible bourbon. Standard expressions widely available at retail typically do not meet our buying criteria."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get an offer for my bourbon?",
      "answer": "Submit photos and a bottle list through our Get an Offer form, or text photos directly to 213-770-9463. We typically respond within one business day."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the original box matter?",
      "answer": "Yes. Original boxes, tubes, and packaging add value for many collectible bourbons. Include photos of any packaging you have."
    },
    {
      "question": "What condition issues disqualify a bottle?",
      "answer": "Opened bottles, compromised seals, significant leakage, and severe damage typically disqualify bottles. Minor cosmetic issues usually reduce value but do not disqualify."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the process take?",
      "answer": "We provide offers within one business day. If you accept, we coordinate shipping or drop-off, then issue payment after inspection. The full process typically takes one to two weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I sell bourbon from any state?",
      "answer": "We can only purchase where legally permitted. After reviewing your submission, we will confirm whether we can proceed based on your location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you charge any fees?",
