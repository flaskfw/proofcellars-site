    {
      "question": "What is the difference between George T. Stagg and Stagg Jr.?",
      "answer": "George T. Stagg is the annual BTAC release, typically aged longer and released once per year. Stagg Jr. (now just called Stagg) is released in batches throughout the year and is more available, though still allocated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which Stagg batches are most valuable?",
      "answer": "Value varies by batch depending on proof, reviews, and availability. We evaluate each batch based on current market demand."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I identify my Stagg Jr. batch?",
      "answer": "The batch number is printed on the label, typically in a format like Batch 1 or with a numerical identifier. The proof also varies by batch."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the tube add value?",
      "answer": "Yes. Original tubes add value for George T. Stagg releases. Stagg Jr. does not typically come with a tube."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Stagg Jr. become just Stagg?",
      "answer": "Buffalo Trace renamed Stagg Jr. to Stagg starting in 2023. Both names refer to the same product line, and we buy all releases under either name."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I receive an offer?",
      "answer": "We typically respond within one business day for Stagg submissions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you verify authenticity?",
      "answer": "Yes. We review photos for authenticity indicators and conduct full verification during physical inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I sell multiple Stagg bottles together?",
