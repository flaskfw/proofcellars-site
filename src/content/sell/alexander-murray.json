            "question": "Do you buy Costco Scotch?",
            "answer": "Yes, if it is the high-age (18-24+ year) single malt series bottled by Alexander Murray."

            "question": "Is 'Undisclosed Speyside' valuable?",
            "answer": "It depends on the age. A 40-year undisclosed Speyside has value, but less than a named Glenfarclas."

            "question": "Do you buy Trader Joe's whisky?",
            "answer": "Only the limited high-age releases (e.g. 20+ year Highland). Not the $20 bottles."
