            "answer": "High ABV spirits (Whiskey, Tequila) are much more resilient. They rarely 'cook' like wine, but evaporation increases."

            "question": "What is seepage?",

            "question": "Will you buy heat damaged wine?",
            "answer": "Generally no, unless it is extremely rare and the damage is minimal/ambiguous. We prioritize quality."
