  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I value a large collection?",
      "answer": "Submit your inventory and we provide an offer based on current market values. This gives you a concrete number without the cost of a formal appraisal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I sell all at once or in batches?",
      "answer": "Either works. Selling all at once is simpler, but batches let you spread out the transaction. We can accommodate your preference."
    },
    {
      "question": "What inventory format do you prefer?",
      "answer": "Cellar management software exports are ideal (CellarTracker, Vinfolio, etc.). Spreadsheets with producer, vintage, quantity, and size also work well."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you need photos of every bottle?",
      "answer": "Not for initial offers on large collections. We may request photos of specific bottles after reviewing the inventory."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the process take for large collections?",
      "answer": "Initial offers typically take three to five business days for large collections. The full process from submission to payment may take three to six weeks depending on size and logistics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you travel for inspections?",
      "answer": "For large collections, we may arrange a virtual walkthrough or in-person inspection depending on location and collection value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I change my mind about some bottles?",
      "answer": "Before accepting an offer, you can adjust what you want to sell. We can provide separate offers for different portions of your collection."
