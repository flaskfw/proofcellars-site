        "For wines, vintage year is important. For spirits, age statements and any special edition names help. Bottle size matters if it is not a standard 750ml.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need to photograph every bottle?",
      "answer": "For small collections, individual photos help. For larger collections, representative photos with counts by section work well."
    },
    {
      "question": "What format should my inventory be in?",
      "answer": "Any format works. Spreadsheet, PDF, handwritten list, or photos of your cellar log. We can work with whatever you have."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I cannot read some labels?",
      "answer": "Send photos anyway. We can often identify wines and spirits from partial label information or bottle shapes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does original packaging always add value?",
      "answer": "For many collectible bottles, original wood cases, boxes, and tubes add meaningful value. Always mention and photograph packaging."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate do counts need to be?",
      "answer": "Reasonably accurate. For large collections, estimates are fine initially. We verify counts when we receive bottles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I text photos instead of using the form?",
      "answer": "Yes. Texting photos and a list to 213-770-9463 (213-770-WINE) works just as well. We take it from there."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I am not the original buyer?",
      "answer": "That is fine. Many sellers inherit or receive bottles as gifts. Just share what you know about the history."
