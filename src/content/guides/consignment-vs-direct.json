        "Sellers with deadlines, those handling estates, and anyone who values certainty over speculation typically prefer direct sale.",

    {
      "question": "Will I get more at auction?",
      "answer": "Sometimes, for rare items with active bidding. But after fees, the difference may be smaller than expected. And you will not know until the auction ends."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are typical auction fees?",
      "answer": "Seller commissions range from ten to twenty-five percent depending on the auction house and lot value. Some also charge insurance, photography, or handling fees."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does auction consignment take?",
      "answer": "Three to six months from submission to payment is typical. Auctions are scheduled periodically, and payment follows after buyers settle."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get offers from both?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can request auction estimates and direct offers to compare. There is no obligation until you commit."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my bottles do not sell at auction?",
      "answer": "Unsold lots are typically returned to you or relisted. You may be charged fees for photography and handling even if items do not sell."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Proof Cellars not charge seller fees?",
      "answer": "We buy directly for our own inventory and network. Our margin comes from the difference between buy and sell prices, not from charging sellers."
