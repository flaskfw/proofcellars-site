        {
            "question": "What is parafilm?",
            "answer": "A laboratory film used to wrap closures to prevent further evaporation. It is okay to use for storage, but remove it or disclose it before selling."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you buy leaking bottles?",
            "answer": "Rarely. If it is a very valuable bottle (e.g., 1945 Mouton), we might buy it as a 'drinker' for a fraction of market price."
        },
        {
            "question": "What about wax seals?",
            "answer": "Wax often hides seepage. If the wax is stained or sticky, the cork underneath has failed."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does shipping cause seepage?",
            "answer": "Yes, if the bottle is subjected to heat or extreme pressure changes in a plane. That's why we use insulated shipping."
