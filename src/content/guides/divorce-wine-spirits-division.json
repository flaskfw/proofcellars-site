    {
      "question": "Do both parties need to approve the sale?",
      "answer": "We confirm authorization before proceeding. This may mean written agreement from both parties or documentation of a court order. We will discuss requirements after reviewing your submission."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I sell before the divorce is finalized?",
      "answer": "It depends on your situation. Some couples agree to liquidate assets during proceedings. Consult with your attorney about what is permitted, then contact us with documentation of authorization."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle payment if proceeds are split?",
      "answer": "We issue payment to the authorized seller. Division of proceeds between parties is handled separately according to your agreement or court order."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my name be public if I sell?",
      "answer": "No. We are a direct buyer, not an auction house. Your identity is not disclosed publicly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my spouse has the bottles but I have the records?",
      "answer": "Coordinate to gather photos from where bottles are stored and records from whoever has them. We can work with partial information and follow up with questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the process take?",
      "answer": "Offers are typically provided within one to three business days. The full process from submission to payment usually takes one to three weeks depending on logistics."

    {
      "question": "Do you provide documentation for court?",
      "answer": "Yes. We provide written offers and receipts that document the sale for legal purposes."
