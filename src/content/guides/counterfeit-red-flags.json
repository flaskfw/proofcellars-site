        "Modern high-resolution printing can reproduce labels well, but subtle differences often remain. Paper weight, texture, and aging patterns should be consistent with the bottle's stated age.",

      "question": "What if my bottles turn out to be counterfeit?",
      "answer": "If we determine bottles are not authentic, we will return them to you. We do not purchase counterfeit or tampered items."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does provenance guarantee authenticity?",
      "answer": "Strong provenance reduces risk but does not eliminate it. Counterfeits have entered even reputable channels. Physical verification matters."
    },
    {
      "question": "How common are counterfeits?",
      "answer": "For common wines and spirits, counterfeits are rare. For highly sought bottles like top Burgundy, first growth Bordeaux, and allocated American whiskey, counterfeits exist in meaningful numbers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I be worried about bottles I inherited?",
      "answer": "Bottles stored in a personal cellar for years are generally lower risk than bottles purchased recently from unknown sources. Provenance through family ownership is often strong."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you authenticate my bottles?",
      "answer": "We verify authenticity as part of our purchase evaluation. We do not offer standalone authentication services."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the most counterfeited bottles?",
      "answer": "Rare Burgundy (especially Domaine de la Romanée-Conti), first growth Bordeaux in great vintages, and highly allocated American whiskey like Pappy Van Winkle are common targets."
