        "Poor condition can reduce value by fifty percent or more compared to the same bottle in pristine condition. For rare wines and spirits, condition can mean the difference between a desirable bottle and one that is difficult to sell.",

      "heading": "Fill Levels",
      "content": [
        "Fill level is the distance from the closure to the liquid surface. For wine, this is measured from the bottom of the cork. For spirits, from the closure or stopper.",
        "Wine naturally loses small amounts of liquid over decades through the cork. Standard fill level terminology ranges from high fill and into neck (excellent) down to mid shoulder and low shoulder (problematic).",
        "Low fills often indicate storage problems or a compromised cork. Buyers discount or avoid bottles with significantly low fills."

      "list": [
        "Into neck or high fill: Excellent, expected for younger wines",
        "Base of neck: Normal for wines over ten years old",

        "Mid shoulder: Significant concern, substantial discount",

        "Label condition affects value, especially for older or collectible bottles. Buyers want labels that are legible, intact, and free from major damage.",
        "Minor scuffing or cellar marks are normal for aged wines and have minimal impact. Significant tears, staining, or fading reduce value. Missing labels make bottles difficult to authenticate and sell.",
        "Back labels, if present, should also be legible. For older bottles, original labels with period-appropriate printing and wear are actually preferred over suspiciously pristine labels."

      "list": [

        "Capsule damage can indicate improper opening attempts, storage issues, or age-related deterioration. Minor wear is normal. Significant damage raises questions.",

        "Provenance, or the documented history of storage, matters especially for older wines. Bottles stored in professional cellars or known collections are worth more than bottles of unknown origin.",
        "Temperature stability is crucial for wine. Bottles stored in fluctuating temperatures, warm environments, or direct sunlight may have deteriorated regardless of fill level.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I sell bottles with condition issues?",
      "answer": "Often yes, at reduced prices. Let us know about condition concerns upfront. We evaluate each bottle individually."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I photograph fill levels?",
      "answer": "Hold the bottle upright, in good light, and photograph so the liquid line is visible against the glass. Include the neck and shoulder in the frame."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does slight label damage matter?",
      "answer": "Minor scuffing has minimal impact. Significant tears, staining, or missing labels reduce value substantially."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I do not know the storage history?",
      "answer": "Just say so. Unknown provenance affects value for older wines but does not prevent a sale."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I clean dusty bottles?",
      "answer": "Leave them as is. Cellar dust can actually help establish authenticity. Aggressive cleaning can damage labels."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does condition matter for spirits?",
      "answer": "Condition matters but less critically than for wine. Fill levels, seal integrity, and packaging are the main factors for spirits."
