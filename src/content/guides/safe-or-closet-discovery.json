    {
      "question": "Are bottles stored in a closet still good?",
      "answer": "It depends on conditions. Cool, dark closets can preserve bottles reasonably well. Hot closets or attics are problematic. Send photos and we will assess condition."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I do not know what I have?",
      "answer": "Send photos. We identify bottles and explain what you have and whether they have value."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I open the boxes to photograph?",
      "answer": "Yes, but carefully. Open boxes to photograph labels, then reseal. We need to see what is inside to provide an offer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if bottles were a gift and I never got details?",
      "answer": "No problem. Photograph labels and packaging. We research and identify bottles based on what is visible."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if bottles are counterfeit?",
      "answer": "We assess authenticity as part of our review. Signs include inconsistent labels, unusual capsules, and other indicators we check when reviewing photos."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the bottles are very old?",
      "answer": "Age can add value for certain wines and spirits, but condition matters more. Very old bottles with good fill levels and intact labels can be quite valuable."
