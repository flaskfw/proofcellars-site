    {
      "question": "What if heirs want different things?",
      "answer": "The executor has authority to make decisions for the estate. Getting a clear valuation often helps heirs agree on a path forward. Selling and dividing proceeds can be simpler than dividing bottles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can one heir buy out the others?",
      "answer": "Yes. Our offer provides a fair market value that can be used as a basis for one heir to buy out others' shares if they prefer to keep the collection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we wait until probate closes?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. Executors can often sell estate assets during administration with proper authorization. Consult with the estate attorney about timing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if some bottles are more valuable than others?",
      "answer": "We evaluate each bottle individually and can break down our offer by wine or category if that helps with discussions among heirs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do we handle storage costs while deciding?",
      "answer": "If the collection is in professional storage with ongoing fees, factor this into timing decisions. We can often complete purchases within two weeks of acceptance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the executor sell without heir agreement?",
      "answer": "Executor authority varies by jurisdiction and will terms. Consult with the estate attorney about the executor's powers and any required approvals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide appraisals for estate purposes?",
      "answer": "We provide offers representing what we will pay, which reflects current market value. For formal appraisals for tax or legal purposes, you may need a certified appraiser."
